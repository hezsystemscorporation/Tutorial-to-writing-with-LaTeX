# Tutorial-to-writing-with-LaTeX

In collaborative academic projects or thesis writing, teams often face a bottleneck: technical members are comfortable with LaTeX, while others (often from Finance, Business, or Social Sciences) struggle with the syntax and environment configuration.

This repository provides a single-file, self-contained LaTeX template designed to bridge that gap. It acts as an interactive tutorial: by compiling it, the user sees a guide on how to write a professional paper, right inside the paper itself.
